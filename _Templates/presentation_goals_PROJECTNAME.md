# Experiment Design 2022

## Symposium self-reflection

project, team:

The purpose of this self-reflection is to learn from the exercise of presenting your project to a public audience. 
Answer the preparation questions **before** the symposium and evaluate them based on your experience **after** the end of the symposium.

## Preparation

### Content: 
+ What makes your pitch attractive?  
+ What do you want the visitors to learn from your pitch?  
+ What elements have you deliberately put in your presentation to reach your goal?  

### Performance:
+ What is **your** goal of presenting your pitch?  
+ What do you want the visitors to remember after coming to your discussion room?  
+ Which indicators show to you that your visitors are engaged with your message?  



## Evaluation
1. What worked well about your pitch and presentation?  
2. What did not work as you expected?  
3. Considering your own indicators, how do you evaluate the success of your final presentation?  
4. What feedback have you received from the visitors about the project and about your way of presenting it?
