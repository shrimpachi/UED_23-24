# Assessment routine
 
For each of the aspects mentioned, the coordinator will give a mark corresponding to adequately acceptable (pass), standing out (bonus), and fair to be penalized (penalty).
 
Translating these markers to numeric grades will be done by matching to the following calibration principles:
                + having at least one bonus point in *major* criteria per each of the 5 categories will earn a full mark in the course
                + getting a pass on all criteria will be equivalent to an 8/10, judged by the norms of the Physics department
                + getting a penalty on every *major* criteria, will result in a grade lower than 7/10.
                + receiving more than ten penalties in all the categories, minor or major, will result in failing the course.
