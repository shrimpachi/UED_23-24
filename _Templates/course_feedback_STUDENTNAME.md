# Experiment Design 2022

## Feedback for the next edition

### Reminder: 

The official learning outcomes, as listed on the course description, are:  
1. After the course, the student is able to acquaint her/himself with the application of an experimental technique and can quantitatively argue the suitability of this technique to a given physical problem.  
2. After the course, the student has a basic knowledge of data analysis/presentation techniques relevant to a given field of research. The student can implement these techniques using a programming language and libraries relevant to that field.  
3. After the course, the student knows how to collect, manage and interpret data in types/formats relevant to their specific field of research.  
4. After the course, the student can discuss, describe and interpret data, both verbally and in the form of a short report.  
5. After the course, students can collaborate in a team to design and carry out a short experimental project.  

The central goal behind these outcomes, however, is **to empower you to take a leading role in tackling grand scientific and technological challenges.** 
For this purpose, a major part of the course focuses on leadership skills, group dynamics, and principles of working in open teams.
