# Experiment Design 2023

Thank you for your participation in the Utrecht Experiment Design course. 
If you have come this far, you are either a student, a mentor, or and expert willing to help. 
This document guides you through the UED2022 repository. 
In theory, this repository must include all the information you need to contribute effectively to the course. 

Everyone taking part in Experiment Design course and discussions (mentors, helpers, coordinators, and learners) is required to conform to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
Please read the code carefully. 
Coordinators will oversee adherence to this code throughout the course.


## As students 

As in most open projects, there is no best way of contributing to the Experiment Design course. 
As a student, following [the syllabus](Syllabus_2023.md) is perhaps the most straightforward path. 

We try to make this repository and its documentation self-contained and instructive. 
You are therefore highly encouraged to use a forked version of UED2022 repo from the start for your documentation. 
If you have not used git version control before, you can find a starters' guide and many good tips in [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-git.html) book. 

### Here is a list of repo-related assignments:

+ Fork this repository into your gitlab account, and make the coordinators and other contributors a member of your project.
+ Create a personal progress checklist from [this template](./_Templates/progress_checklist.md) on the [UED2022 issues](). Assign this issue to yourself. **Timestamps on this issue will be used as the basis for your grading.**
+ As a practice, add your name, issue number, and contact info to [Contact.md](./Contacts.md) in the root directory and submit a merge-request.

### Here is a list of recommendations:
+ After choosing a project, create a subfolder (convention: ProjectName_TeamMembers) in your repo. Keep all your notes, personal goals, meeting notes, and project documentation in a proper folder structure inside this subfolder. *Do not forget to include a* **readme** *file*. 
+ Deliver your assignments by sending merge-requests to the UED2022 origin repo. Make sure you have fixed potential repo-conflicts by fetching the latest version, and use proper commits and pull-request messages.
+ Update your presonal issue regularly with links to assignment files and use the issue thread for Q&A about your progress by tagging the coordinators' alias @Sanli or @a.peters1.
+ Use MS Teams group channels only for instant messaging or for communicating with several other members.
+ Use MS Teams direct chat for private communication with the coordinators and discussing all things non-public.

## As mentors

Mentors' main role is to help the project teams define their path to achiving their project goals. 
On this path they are guides, rather than supervisors, as the full responsibility of the project lies with the students. 
Please have a look at the [roles and responsibilities](./Roles_and_Responsibilities.md) of the various actors.

It is expected from mentors to:  

+ Regularly observe the progress of the project (~15 minutes/week) 
+ Provide advice on project steps or suggest an expert or reading materials 
+ Provide feedback to the mentee to consider 
+ Provide feedback to the course coordinator at the end of the course 

Mentors are also welcome to suggest changes to the [course syllabus](Syllabus_2023.md) or to contribute to any other part of this repository.

**DO NOT change any text above this line without consulting the course coordinators.**
