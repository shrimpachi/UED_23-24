# Experiment Design Syllabus 2023

## Setting expectations

The _official_ learning outcomes of this course are listed in [the course goals](./lectures/course_goals_2023.md).
The listed skills and capabilities are valuable on their own and essential for a distinguished *master* of Experimental Physics. 
The central goal behind these outcomes, however, is to **empower you to take a leading role in tackling grand scientific and technological challenges**. 
For this purpose, a good part of the course focuses on leadership skills, group dynamics, and principles of working in open teams. 

To get closer to achieving this central goal in, next to technical discussions, exercises, and seminars, you will also

+ Learn the principles and vocabularies of:  
	*+* Openness  
	*+* Open Leadership  
	*+* Community interactions  
	*+* Value exchanges  
	*+* Engagement  
	*+* Diversity  
	*+* Inclusion  
	*+* Accessibility  
	*+* Safety  
	*+* Culture change  
+ Learn how to apply those principles to open leadership and working openly in your groups.  
+ Learn how to collect, invite, and tell stories that demonstrate how solving the chosen problems benefits the communities you belong to.  

Some participants in the past editions of this course have expressed their of bewilderment with including these topics, and excercises dedicated to these, in the syllabus.
Some even have suggested in their feedback that the time could be better spent on learning and practicing technical aspects and teaching more "Physics". 
On the other hand, there are always a handful students who complain about others not working as hard as they do, not understanding the close-to-perfect instructions they have written, and not showing enough appreciation for their work. 
Remarkably, the overlap between these two groups is almost like a fully-shaded Venn diagram. 
The common observation is that this group cannot appreciate the connection between what they dismiss and what they expect.

It is understandable that open leadership skills like these might feel irrelevant to people who have not done many team projects, or done it only as an apprentice. 
It is easy to under-appreciate the significance of value exchanges if and have not directly dealt with partially defined and dynamic uncertain project goals.
But, they are essential if you want to flourish in a collaborative project, which is the default for experimental projects nowadays.

If you stay concious and open-minded about the significance of these interpersonal aspects, you will take away **much more valuable** lessons from this course than the piece of hardware you make and analysis your perform.

## This Syllabus

This syllabus is a "living" document. 
The course coordinators are open to suggestions regarding changes to this document or the workflow.
Bring your suggestion up in a cohort meeting, discuss it on Teams, or contact one of the course coordinators.

You can access the lab on other days. For working in the Lili's proto lab, follow the regular in-take procedure on [their website](https://www.uu.nl/lpl). *On top of* the official lecture hours, it is anticipated that you will spend an average of 5-6 hours (outside the lectures) each week on the assignments. 

This schedule is set based on the coordinators' experience with execution of an experimental project and the feedback from the students of last year. This year, because of the extension to a semester course, we may need to readjust the plans. There is no unique path to achieving the course goals and __we will adjust the schedule as necessary during our cohort meetings__.

---

## Week 1 (2023w37) - Introduction and orientation

During this week, we will collect the necessary elements for choosing your project and setting up teams.
All participants will introduce themselves and the coordinators will discuss the goals of the course with you, and explain the suggested path to successfully achieve the learning outcomes. 
The structure of the working hours and cohort meetings will be presented. 
Also the required means of communication will be presented and tested, including a short introduction to the git-workflow and our gitlab repository.

+ [Program and Assignments](./lectures/week1_intro.md)  

---

## Week 2 (2023w38) - Kickstart your project

You form teams, discuss your chosen projects with coordinators and other students, and prepare to present the theoretical background and the relevance of your choice to the rest. 
You will also choose a mentor.

By the end of this week, you must have a list of all the necessary components for your experiment, or be prapared to make them.


+ [Program and Assignments](./lectures/week2_kickstart.md)

## Week 3 (2023w39) - Daring to Try

You will get a tour of Lili's Proto Lab, where you can make the necessary pieces for your measurement setup.
You will learn about 3D modelling and 3D printing.
During this week, you will put together the elements of your experiment and try to make some (any) measurements.

+ [Program and Assignments](./lectures/week3_protolab.md)  

Additionally you will learn about controlling hardware with a computer and writing a simple graphical user interface.

**ATTENTION: hard deadline!**

---

## Weeks 4-7 (2023w40-w43) - The hackathon

You teach others about the Physics relevant for your chosen project and learn further about some generic measurement and control techniques.
You will make a working setup and prepare your documentation for the reproducibility exercise.
You will complete the documentation of your project aimed at reproducibility.

+ [Program and Assignments](./lectures/week4_hackathon.md)  

---

## Week 8 (2023w44) - Reproducibility

You will share your measurement instructions and documentation with others to reproduce your results.
You will form new teams to reproduce another project (solely) based on their documentation, and respond to the feedback on the reprocibility of your own project

+ [Program and Assignments](./lectures/week8_reproducibility.md)  

**ATTENTION: hard deadline!**

---

## Weeks 9-11 (2023w45-w47) - Iterate:

You will learn about examples of successful open hardware initiatives. We will discuss contribution routes and how to recieve credit.
Apply the feedback you have recieved to your project and make a plan for sharing your project and/or your contribution on an open science platform.

+ [Program and Assignments](./lectures/week9_iterate.md)  

**ATTENTION: hard deadline!**

---

## Week 12 (2023w48) - Pre-evaluation

During this week you will discuss the state of your project with the course coordinator and get some feedback and suggestions on what requires a major boost and what are the things that are nice to have.

---
## Weeks 13-17 (2023w49-2024w1) - Boost your project

+ [Program and Assignments](./lectures/week14_boost.md)  
---

## Week 18 (2024-w2)- The final touch

You will get the time to customize your project documentation, and share it with the world. You will make a creative advertisement and your storyline for presenting a compelling story that reflects your learning experience.

---

## Final week (2024-w4) - Tell Your Story:

During this week, you will prepare a poster about your project and publicly present your project for the department.
