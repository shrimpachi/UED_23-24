-Prioritize Safety in the Laboratory:
At the start of the course, I completed additional online safety courses provided by Lili's Protolab. These courses 
equipped me with the necessary knowledge to ensure safety while working in the lab.

-Gain New Skills:
I participated in a 3D printing workshop offered at Lili's Protolab, which provided me with an introduction to develop
new skills in 3D printing.

-Deepen Understanding of Theoretical Principles:
During this period, I conducted further research on the theoretical principles underlying my project. Discussing these
principles with peers, teammates, and professors, offered diverse perspectives and enriched my understanding.

-Enhance Ability to Work Collaboratively in a Team:
Engaging in group projects significantly improved my collaborative skills. This was achieved through active participation 
in discussions, taking on various roles within the team to gain different collaborative perspectives, and openly 
communicating while effectively resolving conflicts.

-Learn How to Design Experiments Effectively:
I enhanced my ability to design experiments by asking clarifying questions, experimenting with simple steps, and seeking 
feedback from my instructors.
