# Personal goals

### POP

+ **Purpose**: to evaluate your own expectations from following the course
+ **Outcome(s)**: list of your goals and agreement on how to evaluate your progress towards them
+ **Process**: self-reflection and discussion with your mentors

STUDENT NAME:

## Personal goals (fill this at the start of the course)
+ I want to learn how I can manage a project.
+ I want to learn a systematic way of setting up a project.
+ I want to learn how you can distribute workload in the best way.
+ I want to learn how to work with gitlab (although I find this software currenly really really awfull)
+ I want to learn more about practical challanges when it comes to designing an experiment when it comes to particle physics.

## Mid-course review of your personal goals (fill this mid-course)
From the project thus far I have noticed that I have learned more on how to approach a project. The first two goals were perhaps not succesfull in practice but I did learn from what we did. For instance:
+ It would have been better to get a more clear view on what we have to do. Ofcourse this can change during the project but ultimately there should be a good base.
+ It should also have been more clear on what the final result should be. Do we want it soldered? Do we want a nice box for it? what connection should we use etc etc. I think this can be summed up to "better prepare the project"


On learning how to distribute the workload I found that communication is very important:
+ How to properly communicate between the members of the group to ensure better workload distribution and better agendas for what to do in the near future. The latter was key for the people who have responsibility over the lab in ornstein where we have our laser setup. As we half forgot to send them in time the dates that we would be working in the lab.
+ When Rimo joined the group there should have been better communication so that everyone knows what is happening. So Rimo should have communated his issues so that we can work around those issues by redistributing the work load so that it would fit the new sircumstance the best.  We should also have communicted better with Rimo on the way we do the project, so explaining when we work what we do when we get stuck on a problem, what to do when something happened personally that could affect the progress of the project etc etc.

I understand the purpose of gitlab or git in general, but at this point I absolutely dispise it when working in a group envoronment. Perhaps this is still the learning curve, but I don't want to be using it in the future again when working on code or projects. Perhaps only when I am working alone on it.

The last goal about how to work on particle physics experiments is completely irrelevent as we did not have a particle physics related experiment.

## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
* Review the course from your personal point of view and whether it met your expectations. State how you could have done better and suggest changes that can make the course better.*
