## Personal goals 
In this course I expect to learn how to be an optimal member of a research collaboration. For me this means that I want to learn:
+ To find my place in a team, my strenghts and my weaknesses.
+ Leadership and collaboration.
+ How to create and maintain structure within a project.
+ How to properly communicate results, methods and feedback to colleagues.
+ How to use GitLab effectively for large project(group)s.

## Mid-course review of your personal goals (fill this mid-course)
Halfway through the project, I already have learned a lot! I discovered that I realy enjoy to take a leading and supervising role in a project group. One of the strengths I think I learned is to keep a good overview of the project and the work of other teammembers, but there are still a lot of leadership skills I would like to learn. One of the skills that would like to learn in the last couple of weeks is to be more organized in the project, especially during meetings, and to communicate better my ideas and expectations to the group. In my own enthusiasm I tend to keep all my ideas in my head and fail to communicate them properly. 

One other thing I learned during this project is how important good documentation is. This applies to both the content of the documentation (what needs to be documented? How do we document it?), as to the structure of the documentation (Where can I find the information I am looking for?). During the project I have come to the opinion that documentation in Gitlab was not convenient for me, as the documentation would not be acessible for me and other students immidiatly to read and give feedback. For this reason we decided in the project to move our documentation to Overleaf where we could write and read all documentation and immidiatly provide it with feedback. This resulted in better structure for me.

During the project we encountered some difficulties with arriving on time for meetings. We had hoped to resolve this issue within the group itself, but in the end we had to involve supervision. This was a great opportunity for me to learn how to deal with issues like this. I learned how important it is to make agreements at the beginning of a project which also include consequences if someone does not stick to these agreements.
