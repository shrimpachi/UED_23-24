## About the ./students directory

In this folder, students store and share their personal assignments.

To participate, create a subdirectory here and keep you personal files in that subdirectory to share them with the instructors and with others. 
The files in your personal subdirectory are the basis for the evaluation of your individually assigned grades.

Use the CamelCase convention (NameSurname) to name your subdirectory.
