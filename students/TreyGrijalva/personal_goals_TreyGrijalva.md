## Personal goals (fill this at the start of the course)
explore more of the facilities and equipment I am partially funding,

improve my technical communication skills with ESL people,

improve my tutoring/teaching habits,

learn technical lab skills, like coil making, since I missed them in my undergrad because of COVID,

learn about the scintillators and other nuke/hep equipment that I've never had access to before


## Mid-course review of your personal goals (fill this mid-course)
*Note what skills you have learned so far, whether you are hitting your own targets and if you need to modify them. State if the course structure allows you to attain your goals.*

I have definitely explored more places around the school because of the course. I've been around Ornstein and Bleeker much more than I would have been otherwise.

There are still a good deal of detail misunderstandings, but I have definitely made some progress courtesy of Pieter and Otto.

I haven't done too much teaching, just a bit of git help for a few people. I cannont say I've done more than refreshed old memories.

My last couple of goals were too ambitious because they aren't happening now and I highly doubt I will have the time to connect any of that to our project.


## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
* Review the course from your personal point of view and whether it met your expectations. State how you could have done better and suggest changes that can make the course better.*
