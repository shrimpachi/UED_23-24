Gerasimos Niforos:

## Personal goals 
In this course I hope to gain valluable experiences through collaborating, building and running modern physics' experiments. More specifically I expect to:
+ Help my teammates with the things I know and learn from them things I don't know.
+ Achieve greater things together than we would have done alone.

I also expect to learn more on:
+ How to organise priorities and time management.
+ How to properly analyse and communicate results to colleagues.
+ How to present thoroughly and in a nice way the initial idea, the running and the final results of an experiment.
+ How to use GitLab effectively for large projects.
