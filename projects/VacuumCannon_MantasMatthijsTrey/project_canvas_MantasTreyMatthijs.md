PROJECT NAME: Vacuum Cannon

TEAM: Mantas, Trey and Matthijs

## Project description  
The premise of our experiment is to create a vacuum cannon that does not require a vacuum pump that can propel ping pong balls or other projectiles at high speeds merely due to air pressure and the presence of a vacuum in a tube. 
There is some evidence that suggests that these projectiles can reach supersonic speeds even though the theory prohibits this. We desire to build a robust dataset by measuring speed and impact force that can perhaps shed more light on whether these models correctly depict the projectile velocity.
Here is an example of a similar cannon that we are modeling ours after. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ydJXOTf1-4
### Open Hardware and its purpose
We are not using any direct open hardware, so will have to build and fabricate all of the materials required for our experiment ourselves. 

### Potential users of the hardware and its added value
We think there is numerous applications to such a vacuum cannon, such as launching probes in space where a vacuum may be easily attainable. This understanding of the airflow into a vacuum could also have numerous implications for aerospace engineering and other applications.
In addition, the vacuum cannon we are creating is very cheap and easy to create, and therefore could be something that may have some use for any system requiring a piston action, that can easily use energy stored by hand (using a handle or crank to pull back the action)

### Underlying physics and working principles
- According to some models the theoretical maximum velocity is independent of the vacuum cannon diameter and projectile mass and is significantly lower than the speed of sound. Some experimental sources have suggested that this may indeed not be the case.
- The problem can be set up as a simple difference in pressure that accelerates the projectile and with constant acceleration this would predict that the speed would depend only on tube length. The actual situation is somewhat more complicated, because the air pressure must accelerate not only the projectile but also the air column behind the projectile.
- Beginning with F = dP/dt , we obtain PA = d/dt {(m + ρxA)v}
- Setting up the theory this way we obtain a formula for the velocity v(x) = vmax [x/(x + λ)sqrt(1 + 2λ/x)] where λ is characteristic length m/pA.
- However this theory already contains many assumptions - That the projectile fits —and seals— the barrel perfectly, and thateffects due to friction, viscosity, and compressibility are negligible. If our experiment does not fit the expected results we will attempt to see which of these estimations - or perhaps a different error - is responsible.


### Required components and planned alteration to the reported recipe
- Two pipes that fit within each other
- A brace and bracket system to secure the cannon
- Projectile - pingpong balls
- O-rings and material to create a seal in the tube
- A ratchet and puly system to pull back the inner tube
- Breakaway seals for the vacuum side of the tube - aluminum foil and tape
- Arduino
- Laser gates or high speed optical cameras
- Piezosensors

### Chosen method of interfacing with a computer
Our sensors will be monitored and recorded by the computer. We could also potentially have the system be pulled back by a motor connected to a computer, but this would be a secondary objective as it is not at all necessary to achieve our goals.

### Planned measurements
Velocity measurements from optical sensors
Force measurements from impact sensors
Volume and mass measurements for our experimental setup
