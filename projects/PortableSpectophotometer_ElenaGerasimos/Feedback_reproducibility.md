## Report 

### Documentation:

1. Could you understand the purpose of the experiment? 
- The purpose of the experiment was clearly explained in the README and project canvas. 
2. Were the safety instructions clear? 
- There were not much safety issues, but the one safety instruction to not overflow the cuvette was stated clearly. 
3. Was the starting point and the expected duration of the measurements clear in the documentation? 
- The instructions on how to reproduce the measurements were really clear. Only the expected duration of the measurements were missing. Possibly when the program is working, you might immediatly see results or see the progress, but since the program was not working, the duration was not clear. 
4. Does the documentation contain all necessary information to successfully reproduce the measurement? If not, what was missing? 
- We believe that if the program was functioning, we would be able to perfeclty reproduce the results based on the documentation.  
5. Did you get stuck at some point? What extra help did you need to proceed?  
- We got stuck on the program which was not functioning. 
6. Are you encouraged to reproduce previous measurements? How easily could you navigate through the project documentation? 
- The README file could contain a bit more explanation about the type of measurements that are performed and described in the instructions. Or alternatevely you could write some sort of introduction in the instructions file to explain the type of instructions before explaining how to perform them.  
7. What can be improved in the documentation? 
+ Short introduction about the type of measurements in the instruction file
+ Clear structure in the instruction file, for instance paragraph separation.
+ More informative pictures, also place them in the instructions file in stead of only in your project folder
+ We are also missing plots of the results, however it is very helpfull to also have the .txt files so we know what type of results we can expect.


On the scale of 1-5 (1: top quality, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the documentation? Please justify your grade based on the questions above.


#### Documentation grade: $`\textcolor{green}{\text{4}}`$

The documentation was clear, short but complete apart from some small things as stated above.

### Measurements:

1. Can you operate the setup with the provided instructions? 
- In theory we could, if the program would have worked. 
2. How close were the results you obtain to the previously reported results? 
- Because of the software problems, we did not obtain results.  
3. Is the analysis procedure easy to understand? Summarize it briefly in your own words. 
- There is not (yet) an analysis procedure. 
4. Is the setup robust and safe to operate? 
- Yes, the setup was very nice, only the cover did not completely close and could fall of easily.  
5. Did you encounter any issues? Could you troubleshoot those issues without contacting the owners? 
- Yes we had some software issues that could not be solved by anyone.  
6. What part of the measurement procedure did you appreciate most? 
- We appriciated how simple and short the measurements were, we did not have to build anything for the setup and with just a few clicks on the laptop the measurements (should have) started and give immidiate results.  

On the scale of 1-5 (1: top quality, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the measurements reproducibility? Please justify your grade based on the questions above.

#### Reproducibility grade: $`\textcolor{green}{\text{4}}`$

If the program would have worked, the reproducibility of the measurements would have been good. Since you also had problems with the program, it would have been nice to added this to your documentation, maybe as a project status or something.

### Interactions:

1. If you had to perform work on this part of the project, would you have selected the same goal or aimed at something else? Please, explain. 
- This project has a lot of varyability on measurement goals, measuring green tea is definetly a unique goal and we really like it.  
2. Which instructions did you need from the owners on top of the written files? 
- The only comment we got from the owners was that the program was not alsways working for them either. 
3. Does the experiment accomplish its stated purpose? 
- Not yet 
4. What do you recommend to the project owners to improve their complete package? 
- Work on a program that does work, and then add some analysis on the measurements like drawing plots and statistics.
