## Report 

### Documentation:

1. Could you understand the purpose of the experiment? Explain.  
The purpose of the experiment is clear. 

2. Were the safety instructions clear?  
There were no safety instructions. So we cannot say anything about it.

3. Was the starting point and the expected duration of the measurements clear in the documentation?  
There were instructions on the starting point. An estimation of the duration of the experiment was not given. This was expected as the project has not finished yet. 

4. Does the documentation contain all necessary information to successfully reproduce the measurement? If not, what was missing?  
For the most part it was very clear what we had to do. However, the links to the pictures were not linked correctly and when we were trying to find the pictures, it does not have the same name as written in the readme file. In addition, it was not very clear how we could check each step before proceeding to the next one. 

5. Did you get stuck at some point? What extra help did you need to proceed?  
Yes, we got stuck as it was not very clear if we should have used an arduino, multimeter or oscilliscope and how to connect everything to the breadboard, e.g. where to connect the output signal to show the high pass filter output. 

While reading the instuctions, we could reproduce a signal on the oscilloscope but the phase shift was not observed as it should be visible. 

6. Are you encouraged to reproduce previous measurements? How easily could you navigate through the project documentation?  
Yes, we were encouraged to reproduce previous measurements. The provided images were a nice addition to have an idea what the output signal should be. For the most part, it was easy to nbavigate through the project folder. As mentioned above, the pictures were not linked and this made it more difficult to find the correct pictures for each part. 

7. What can be improved in the documentation?  
The image quality (e.g. how to connect the cables to check if each part works). Links (as we said before). Make the instructions about the arduino and python script more detailed. 

On the scale of 1-5 (1: top quality, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the documentation? Please justify your grade based on the questions above.

#### Documentation grade: 2 - 2.5
All the documentations were very clear. As it is still the beginning phase of the porject we did not expect to have a very clear and detailed description on how everything works. If the mentioned issues were provided, then the results should be able to be reproduced.

### Measurements:

1. Can you operate the setup with the provided instructions?
We managed to operate it. It was rather a bit difficult to begin and we were not sure what we did was correct. 

2. How close were the results you obtain to the previously reported results?  
We were not able to reproduce the phase shift as shown in the provided result. 

3. Is the analysis procedure easy to understand? Summarize it briefly in your own words. 
N/A we are still in the beginning phase of the project. No analysis could be done. 

4. Is the setup robust and safe to operate?  
There were no accidents, so I guess it is safe to say that is safe to operate. However, the cables were a bit losely connected. 

5. Did you encounter any issues? Could you troubleshoot those issues without contacting the owners?  
The issues we encoutered have been mentioned before. But it was easily cleared. 

6. What part of the measurement procedure did you appreciate most? 
The pictures provided. It was a bit messy, but we managed to understand how to connect most of the cables.  

On the scale of 1-5 (1: top quality, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the measurements reproducibility? Please justify your grade based on the questions above.

#### Reproducibility grade: 2.5 - 3
As it was more difficult to set it up than finding the right doucmentation, the grade is a bit lower. However, it is still the beginning of the project, so for now it is pretty good. 

### Interactions:

1. If you had to perform work on this part of the project, would you have selected the same goal or aimed at something else? Please, explain.  
We would have chosen the same goal. It was pretty clear what the goal is and we think that showing that a cheaper version of a FaradayLIA works the same as an expensive one is a good tool to demonstrate in educational settings. 

2. Which instructions did you need from the owners on top of the written files?  
The cables, as not all were in the box. They did explain that there were not many cables so they did not keep a few for their own. 

3. Does the experiment accomplish its stated purpose?  
No, it has not finished yet as it is still the beginning state of the project.

4. What do you recommend to the project owners to improve their complete package?  
As mentioned above, there are a few issues and if these were resolved it would have been a better complete picture. 
However, we know that we are still in the beginning phase of the project and it is not finished yet.

### Response to reviewers

_This part must be filled by the project owners based on the peer feedback_

1. Which major adjustments did you make based on this feedback?  
2. Do you agree with the graded assessment of the reviewer?  

On the scale of 1-5 (1: really helpful, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the peer evaluation? Please explain.
