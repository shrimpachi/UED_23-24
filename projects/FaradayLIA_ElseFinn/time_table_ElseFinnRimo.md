# Time Table
This is the estimated time-table for the FaradayLIA project based on the information that we currently (28-09-2023) have.

Order of predicted steps:
+   28-09-2023: Completing the components list and hand it in. (mail the list to Dante)
+   02-10-2023: Conduct extensive research on the physical theory behind a LIA and the faraday effect. As well as taking into account what simulations we can make and run.
    + what simulation is needed
    + inherint frequencies of components/what maximum frequencies can components handle
    + whether the environment influences the circuit (does it need a shield)
    + arduino resolution (8 or 16 bit, impact on measured data)
    + possible use of low noise components if deemed necesarry.
    + Gather all theories about the faraday effect. 
+   05-10-2023: Presenting the project as a whole, thus the motivation, theory, simulation and the measurements.
+   12-10-2023: make and test the first LIA prototype (given that all the components are available). The test can be done through the use the arduino sending out an ac signal as an input signal. As well as starting with making the simulation.
+   19-10-2023: Make the faraday setup and testing it with a certified lia. If this was done swiftly, make a measurement with the self made LIA. Calculate the signal that we should measure and see if it is necesarry to use an amplifier.
