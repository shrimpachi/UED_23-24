## Report 

### Documentation:

1. Could you understand the purpose of the experiment? Explain.  
I understood the purpose of the experiment clearly. It had a clear goal with an explenation on how to do it. The documentation is a bit chaotic/sloppy but after reading evertyhing you do understand what it is about. 
2. Were the safety instructions clear?  
I have not read any safety instructions, so no. They could have mentioned that the aluminium plate would be hot, but I don't think that it is necesarry to mention that as the whole purpose of the plate is to get hot. That is at this point survival of the fittest.
3. Was the starting point and the expected duration of the measurements clear in the documentation?  
Partially, it contained information on how long the heater had to warm up to reach equilibrium. But that is it.
4. Does the documentation contain all necessary information to successfully reproduce the measurement? If not, what was missing? 
Not at all. I got stock early on as the documentation lacked instructions for people who are completely new to the equipment presented. I had to figure out by searching through their project folder which color brace I needed to use. I could not find in the manual to check what the spectrum at room temperature was, I did not know how to find it in the IR camera. I had to check whether autofocus was on, I was unable to find that setting. Doing the callibration with the thermocouple (which later turned out I did not have to do), I got to weirdest results, from which followed that I had to conclude that the device was not functioning properly. (as it turned out later, the thermocouple was indeed defect)
5. Did you get stuck at some point? What extra help did you need to proceed?  
I got stuck at the callibration proces, i had to get help to instruct me on what the next steps are. I got told only hit the callibration butteon and then proceed. It later turned out that the code was not fit to analyse the data. It had to be changed in several ways to compensate for the file type that the IR camera software produced and to compensate for using images and not videos.
6. Are you encouraged to reproduce previous measurements? How easily could you navigate through the project documentation?  
It was a bit chaotic. I was not necesarry encouraged, but that is not really that odd as the project is just getting started. 
7. What can be improved in the documentation?  
Work more ordely (make the documentation more orderly). Be more clear in what steps to make (allmos to the point that you are talking to a todler) and remove information that is not necesarry. 

On the scale of 1-5 (1: top quality, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the documentation? Please justify your grade based on the questions above.

From what I experienced as described above, I rate it a 2.

#### Documentation grade:

### Measurements:

1. Can you operate the setup with the provided instructions?  
no
2. How close were the results you obtain to the previously reported results?  
very much off, in the end after help with adjusting the code I could produce an image as they expected I would be able to. Not the intention I got from the documentation. That stated that I should make a video and heat everything up, which I later got told was not necesarry.
3. Is the analysis procedure easy to understand? Summarize it briefly in your own words. 
It was understandable. 
4. Is the setup robust and safe to operate?  
It is, the heater itself has lights indicating if it is too hot to touch, after you placed everything down (when the heater is still cool), you don't have to touch it anymore and is in that sense safe. It is robust in the sense that nothing is really wobbly, only the aluminium plate on the heater itself shakes a bit.
5. Did you encounter any issues? Could you troubleshoot those issues without contacting the owners?  
yes and no
6. What part of the measurement procedure did you appreciate most?  
Honestly not much as it was a lot of troubleshooting that in the end was deemed unnecesarry. The final result was an image (which is not weird for a first signal), which was a bit satisfying after all the unnecesarry troubleshooting.

On the scale of 1-5 (1: top quality, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the measurements reproducibility? Please justify your grade based on the questions above.
 
From what I experienced as described above, I rate it a 2.

### Interactions:

1. If you had to perform work on this part of the project, would you have selected the same goal or aimed at something else? Please, explain.  
No I think the goal is good. It seems very reachable after a bit more work.
2. Which instructions did you need from the owners on top of the written files?  
+ not needing the elaborate callibration method
+ not needing to measure the temperature of the plate with a thermocouple
+ placing the image in the same file as the code
+ adjust three lines of in the code for the code to function properly
3. Does the experiment accomplish its stated purpose?  
+ In the end yes.
4. What do you recommend to the project owners to improve their complete package?  
Documentation, it is too chaotic and there is too much wrong information in there after having talked to one of the project members.

### Response to reviewers

_This part must be filled by the project owners based on the peer feedback_

1. Which major adjustments did you make based on this feedback?  

We changed the README file to be more accessible and clearer as it was indeed lacking information.
However, our project canvas has not been updated yet, but will be when the project is in a more finished state.

2. Do you agree with the graded assessment of the reviewer?  

Yes we do agree with the grade given to us. 

On the scale of 1-5 (1: really helpful, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the peer evaluation? Please explain.
2, as it was helpful to us what we needed to change and what was good about it.
