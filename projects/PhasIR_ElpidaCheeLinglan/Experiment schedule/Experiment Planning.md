Here is a detailed overview of our experiment planning concerning calibrations and measurements, including all the 
parameters we need to take into account.

## 1. Check the heating plate working properly and the temperature deviation

+ Place the aluminium plate with water solution in the centre of the heating plate because it needs to be over the hottest 
part of the plate.
+ Set the desired temperature and  start the heating function.
We set the temperature at 40°C  and measure the temperature of the solution with a thermocouple .
We measure  the temperature of water in  different spots of the aluminium plate.Specifically , we measured the temperature 
in the four corners and the centre of the aluminium plate to check the temperature deviation.

It is expected to give homogeneous results ,although noting potential temperature differences at the edges is normal 
due to thermal effects.
  
## 2. Calibration of Thermal Camera:

Flir is auto calibrated camera that does calibration when needed .
(We just need to press the calibration button before starting the video capturing in the Flir Thermal Studio environment)


## 3. Calibration of PhasIR Setup:

Calibrate the PhasIR setup for accuracy. Use candelia wax with known thermal properties:

A. Place the material into conical holes.
B. Set the thermal plate temperature to 78°C and allow it to reach this temperature.
C. Capture temperature data on videos.
Optional: Perform backward calibration by setting a different temperature,from high to low, to observe the opposite process of hardening of wax. .

## 4. Measurements for the Studied Material (Soy Wax):
Apply the same  process as candelia wax melting point was measured to study the melting point of soy wax. Collect data, create graphs, and compare the values with literature and those obtained during candelia wax calibration. Additionally, assess the thermal stability of materials based on their melting points, as higher melting points indicate better stability
