Here is an our time planning for both the  assignments and  the experiment setup of PhasIR

By 5 October     
Tasks 
+ [x] Confirmation about the components -Start gathering-Placed order for components need to be purchased/design items need to be 3D printed
+ [x] Search on literature (soy wax melting point, IR camera working principles/calibration,)
+ [x] Be more specific about the purpose and measurements of the experiment.

By 12 October
+ [x] 3D Print insulation frame - Pull up Feature
+ [x] Design the conical walls in the aluminium plate - Black paint it/ Get backup aluminium plates.
+ [x] Buy the under study materials (soy wax ,candelia wax)
+ [x] Start research on underlying physics of PhasIR - Getting ready for the presentation on 19th Of October.
+ [x] Changes on Project Canvas (experiment goal was reevaluated)

Note : If all the components are gathered start setting up PhasIR 

By 19 October
+ [x] Get ready for the presentation of the theoritical backround of PhasIR
+ [x] Calibrate PhasIR -Get the first signals 

By 25 October
