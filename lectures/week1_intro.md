## Week 1 - Introduction and orientation

During this week, we will collect the necessary elements for choosing your project and setting up the teams.


### Lectures this week 
+ On the discovery of superconductivity and who created the Science factory?
+ Git workflow basics
+ Communication tools necessary for this course and the self-study material

### Cohort meetings 

+ 2-min introduction of all students and their expectation from the course
+ The cohort theme - open hardware for science
+ Decide collectively on our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT_2022.md)
+ Choosing a "value"able open hardware project (discussions based on the lecture of George Whitesides)

#### TODO: before next week
+ Watch the [speech of George Whitesides](https://vimeo.com/96076471) and prepare for discussions
	- Protagonist: Making a broadly useful science-based product is a noble goal, we should all choose.
	- Antagonist: What is in it for me?
+ Think of a name to suggest for this cohort.
+ Activate your account on the [Science Faculty Gitlab](https://git.science.uu.nl) server.
+ Make sure you have access to the [UED2023 repository](https://git.science.uu.nl/ued2023/ued2023). Fork it to your account and clone it on your PC. Create your first merge (second?) request by inserting your [contact](./Contacts.md).
+ Create a personal issue based on [this template](./_Templates/progress_checklist_COPYtoISSUE.md).
+ Fill in your [personal goals form](./_Templates/personal_goals_STUDENTNAME.md) and put *the link* in your presonal issue.
+ Explore these resources to choose an open hardware project:
    - [OPEnS laboratory](https://github.com/OPEnSLab-OSU/OPEnS-Lab-Home/wiki)
	- [HardwareX](https://www.hardware-x.com)
	- [Journal of Open Hardware](https://openhardware.metajnl.com/)
	- [Open Source Lab on Appropedia](https://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab)
+ Refresh your memory about [python basics](./lectures/homework/some_python_basics.py)
+ Prepare for the interactive coding lecture on thursday by following [these instruction](./lectures/homework/labphew_lecture_homework.md)	

*In case you hesitate which project is suitable and feasible in the limited time of this course, you can contact @Sanli after selecting 3 projects that are close to your interests*
