## Week 3 - Daring to Try

During this week, you will put together the elements of your experiment and try to make some (any) measurements.


### Lectures this week 
+ Introduction to the Lili's protolab by Peiter Kooijman
+ Rapid prototyping and 3D design.

#### TODO: Before next week
+ Make a timeplan for execution of your project and compare your plan with the the other teams.
+ Confirm availability of all the components for your project with Pieter and Dante. Or ask if they can be purchased.
+ Create an issue in the main repo for [giving feedback](./_Templates/feedback_projectcanvas_CREATEanISSUE.md) to at least one project canvas other than your own.
