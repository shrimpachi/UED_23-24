# Course goals 2023-24

* After the course, the student is able to acquaint her/himself with the application of an experimental technique and can quantitatively argue the suitability of this technique to a given physical problem.
* After the course, the student has a basic knowledge of data analysis/presentation techniques relevant to a given field of research. The student can implement these techniques using a programming language and libraries relevant to that field.
* After the course, the student knows how to collect, manage and interpret data in types/formats relevant to their specific field of research.
* After the course, the student can discuss, describe and interpret data, both verbally and in the form of a short report.
* After the course, students can collaborate in a team to design and carry out a short experimental project.
