## Week 4 - The Hackathon

During this and the next 2 weeks, you work intensively towards executing your project and preparing the instructions for another team to reproduce your results. 
You prepare the necessary code for analysing your measured data and recovering the errors in an efficient way. 
Try to test your analysis methods on benchmark measurements and identify the sources of noise and error in your experiment.

**Be prepared for a couple of loooong working days**


### Cohort meetings 

There will be no cohort meetings on Thursdays 5th and 12th of October because you will be very busy with making your setup work. On the cohort meeting of Thursday 19th, discuss the state of your setup and first measurement with Sanli.



#### TODO: 
+ Before Thursday 5th:
	+ Add a license to your project. [Here is some help](https://choosealicense.com/) and here is [some instruction specific to hardware](https://hackmd.io/B3NgBfNHQcq_rE7LEadhuQ?view#What-licenses-to-use) licenses!
+ 	Before Thursday 19th:
	+ Prepare a presentation about the Physics behind your selected measurement. You have to present for the class on Thursday 19th.
