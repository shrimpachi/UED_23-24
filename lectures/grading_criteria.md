# Assessment routine

For each of the aspects mentioned, the coordinator will give a mark corresponding to adequately acceptable (pass), deserving a prize (bonus), and fair to be penalized (penalty). 

Translating these markers to numeric grade will be done by matching to the following calibration principles:
	+ having at least one bonus point per each of the 5 categories will earn a full mark in the course
	+ getting a pass on all criteria will be equivalent to an 8/10, judged by the norms of the Physics department
	+ getting a penalty on each and every *major* criteria, will result in a grade lower than 7/10.
	+ reciving more than ten penalties in all the categories, minor or major, will result in a fail.

# Objections

If you have an objection to the decided criteria and weights, even if you think you are in the minority, please discuss it with the coordinators before the end of week 4. After this date, the grading criterita for this year will be fixed. Your objections at any moment will certainly be taken into account for the following editions of the course.
